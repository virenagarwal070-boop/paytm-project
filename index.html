    <p>
      Paytm, meaning “Pay Through Mobile,” is one of India’s biggest FinTech success stories under the Digital India initiative.
      Launched in 2010 by Vijay Shekhar Sharma, it started as a mobile and DTH recharge platform.
    </p>

    <p>
      Its major growth came after 2016 with the introduction of the Paytm Wallet and the rise of UPI payments.
      Today, Paytm works as a payments bank and a complete digital financial ecosystem.
    </p>

    <div class="highlight">
      <p>
        The backbone of Paytm payments is QR code and UPI technology.
        The QR code acts as a digital address containing the merchant’s UPI ID.
        When scanned, it ensures fast and error-free payments.
      </p>
    </div>

    <p>
      UPI enables real-time money transfer directly from the customer’s bank account to the merchant’s account.
      Each transaction is secured using encryption and a personal UPI PIN.
    </p>

    <p>
      Paytm also offers banking, investments, insurance, bill payments, FASTag, and ticket bookings.
      These services save time and make digital finance accessible to all.
    </p>

    <p>
      By reducing cash usage and increasing transparency, Paytm has helped small vendors,
      improved financial inclusion, and supported economic growth in India.
    </p>

      Understanding this technology helps us understand the future of digital finance.
